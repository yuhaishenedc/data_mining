## 1 [Wine Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews)
130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description
### description
#### Context
After watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine, but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this, please post them!

#### Content
This dataset contains three files:

winemag-data-130k-v2.csv contains 10 columns and 130k rows of wine reviews.

winemag-data_first150k.csv contains 10 columns and 150k rows of wine reviews.

winemag-data-130k-v2.json contains 6919 nodes of wine reviews.
